Module 3 Challenge

Hello ! For Module 3 - the assignment was to create two separate analysis via Python Code. Once python script has been created and has been ran smoothly with correct analysis, proceed with creating a repository via github. After repository has been created, create folders for the separate analyses (PyBank and PyPoll). Under each folder, create three more folders with main.py (for the python script), Resources (the csv used for the analysis) and analysis (for the results).
